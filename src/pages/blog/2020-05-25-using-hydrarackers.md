  On a recent drilling campaign on the Maersk Viking in West Africa, RIGPRO
  operational petrophysicists worked with the drill crew and service company on
  a new innovate technique to deploy logging tools into the active well. The
  Hydraracker PRS system was utilized for conveyance from the offline well
  center to the main after a full function check saving over 10 days rig time
  over a 6 well project. A first in the industry!
