  On a recent drilling campaign on the Maersk Viking in West Africa, RIGPRO
  operational petrophysicists worked with the drill crew and service company on
  a new innovate technique to deploy logging tools on the drill floor. Two
  Hydraracker PRS system was utilized for conveyance from the auxiliary well
  center and aux mouse hole to the main well center after a full function check
  saving over 10 days rig time over a 6 well project. A first in the industry!

Utilizing two Hydraracker's for non conventional open hole logging rigging has many benefits:

* Offline rig up in the aux well and mouse hole off the critical path requiring no rig time
* Allows for full function test of tools before deploying to the active well 
* Allows the service companies to install auxiliary hardware on the tool string off the critical path and at no expense of online rig time.
* Offline rig down of tool strings off the critical path resulting in even more rig time savings

This innovative technique requires extensive planning and additional equipment including the following:

* Personnel
* Surface Equipment
* Rig up gear
