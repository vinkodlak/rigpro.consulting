Maintenance of wireline equipment is one of the important aspects of a successful project. This can not be over-stressed. At this stage, our Client will have a robust Contract in place to protect the Operator from unnecessary costs related to the equipment maintenance.

We are able to review maintenance status remotely (from the office) but the most thorough examination can be performed only when our expert is on spot - at the Service Provider's maintenance facility. We will ensure that the client does not pay for tools until they have met a ridged quality control inspection and are fit for purpose.
