Maintenance of wireline equipment is probably the most important aspect of a successful project. This can't be overstressed. At this stage, our Client will have a robust Contract in place to protect the Operator from unnecessary costs related to the equipment maintenance.

We are able to review maintenance status remotely (from the office) but the most thorough examination can be performed only when our expert is on spot - at the Service Provider's base.
