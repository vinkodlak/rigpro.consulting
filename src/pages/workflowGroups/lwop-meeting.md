Logging well on paper - a huge step to improving operational efficiency. We get together all the key people - wireline engineers and operators, drilling supervisor, tool pusher and performance coach - and run through the job, step-by-step. This is a powerful exercise and test of preparedness - and usually results in a number of suggestions for improvement. Minutes of meeting are subsequently incorporated in the final logging program.
