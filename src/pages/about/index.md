    From deserts to subarctic. Trucks, land operations, jack-ups, drilling
    ships, semi-submersible rigs....you name it, we've been there. We've been
    involved in well-established operations, and we also ran remote projects
    with only a fistful of people.


    Our particular stronghold are highly demanding operations with limited
    support, one-off projects requiring extensive planning for a seamless
    execution. That's where we shine.
