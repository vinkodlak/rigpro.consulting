    From deserts to subarctic we travel. Trucks, jack-ups, drillships,
    semi-submersible rigs, land, deep water....you name it, we've been there.
    We've been involved in well-established operations as well as small remote
    projects with only a fistful of personnel.


    Our particular stronghold includes highly demanding remote operations with
    limited resources and support, the one-off projects that require extensive
    planning for a seamless execution. This is where we shine!
