      Our experts are proficient in the tendering procedure and are able to
      review and analyse the tender package, and provide a constructive input.


      This is an extremely critical stage in which any ambiguities need to be
      identified and resolved. The consequences of an inadequate tendering
      process are severe and costly.

      Depending on the specific requirements, our team will assist throughout
      the tendering process.

      We always advise our Clients to allow access to the contract between the
      Client and the service company in order for our experts to scrutinize, to
      ensure full compliance and transparency throughout the project.

      Reviewing the contract by an expert has been proven beneficial for the
      operator, over and over again.  Don't let the service companies up-sell
      you equipment that is not necessary to the operation, or leave you short
      of critical equipment required for the campaign.

      Maintenance of wireline equipment is one of the most critical aspects of a
      successful project. This cannot be stressed enough! At this stage, our
      Client will have a robust contract in place to protect the Operator from
      unnecessary costs related to the equipment maintenance.


      We are able to review maintenance status remotely (from the office), but
      the most thorough examination is performed only when our expert is on site
      - at the Service Provider's maintenance facility. We will ensure that the
      Client does not pay for tools until they have met a ridged quality control
      inspection and are fit for purpose.
    description: >-
      How many times have you ended up paying for a pile of tools that didn't
      even work and then pay to have them repaired?

    title: Maintenance status scrutinized

      Not only that - we will ensure the wireline contractor has delivered the
      equipment and is ready to perform all services, inclusive of all
      non-routine scenarios; drilling support, emergency procedures, etc.


      We will audit all equipment and validate that all certifications are in
      date and work with the maintenance staff on a comprehensive maintenance
      plan for all equipment for the duration of the project.

      We will match the equipment with the contractual obligations and ensure
      sure you are not paying for your neighbor's Porsche.

      Enforcing the Service provider's own best practices is the best forerunner
      to a LTI-free logging operation. Too many times we've heard about the
      expensive down-time incurred by inadequate tool checks on site.


      All the auxiliaries (stand-offs, decentralizers, low friction rollers) are
      attached to the string, OD's physically measured and photos taken. We
      leave nothing to chance.
    description: >-
      With a proposed logging program, we work hand in hand with the logging
      crew to ensure all the logging string combos are thoroughly tested.

      This is a routine operation, providing all the planning was thoroughly
      laid out prior to the load out. At this stage, it is too late to think
      about the unit zonation, or devise a plan to change out the logging cable!

      Logging Well on Paper - a huge step to improving operational efficiency.
      We gather all the key people - wireline engineers and operators, drilling
      supervisor, tool pusher and performance coach - and run through the job,
      step-by-step. This is a powerful exercise and test of preparedness - and
      usually results in a number of suggestions for improvement. Minutes of the
      meeting are subsequently incorporated in the final logging program.

      RIGPRO consultants are on site 24/7 and live through the operation with
      the logging crew. Our experts blend with the team to ensure no corners are
      cut and procedures are followed. All the activities and operational times
      are tracked in RIGPRO Wireline QAQC software to the second. Office teams
      are able to witness the operation as it unfolds, on their laptops and
      mobile phones. Operational database is created on the go and contains real
      time events.

      Within 24 hours from rigging down wireline, an AAR meeting is held with
      the key team members. Every step of the job is critically reviewed.
      Continuous improvement is driven by adding the lessons learned to the
      RIGPRO database and incorporating into future logging programs.

      Advanced statistical analysis, which is available in RIGPRO Wireline QA/QC
      software, helps us to break down the operation by segments, and to focus
      on areas where the most significant savings are achievable- without
      jeopardizing safety or data quality. This goes without saying!

      The review of the data quality is only a single part of the LQC report. A
      typical report produced by RIGPRO Wireline QA/QC software will contain
      much more - from well information, personnel and equipment overview,
      various time analyses all the way to lessons learned and suggestions for
      future improvements. The whole package!

      Believe it or not, a typical exploration logging job will result in close
      to a hundred distinct products! It is imperative to closely track the
      status and ensure delivery of exceptional quality logs and data in a
      timely manner. 


      This is where a well-written SOP, with a well-defined Data Matrix, is
      essential to identify all the requirements of the Client. All the data
      must be delivered before the end of the project! Once the project team is
      released, it becomes very difficult to finalize any additional data
      requirements.
