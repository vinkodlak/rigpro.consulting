      Our experts are proficient in tendering procedure and are able to review
      and analyse tender package, and provide a constructive input.


      This is a critical stage in which any ambiguities need to be resolved,
      since after effects of inadequate tendering process are severe and costly.

      We coordinate between all the parties, to produce a detailed,

      Maintenance of wireline equipment is one of the important aspects of a
      successful project. This can not be over-stressed. At this stage, our
      Client will have a robust Contract in place to protect the Operator from
      unnecessary costs related to the equipment maintenance.


      We are able to review maintenance status remotely (from the office) but
      the most thorough examination can be performed only when our expert is on
      spot - at the Service Provider's maintenance facility. We will ensure that
      the client does not pay for tools until they have met a ridged quality
      control inspection and are fit for purpose.
    description: >-
      How many times have you ended up paying for a pile of tool that didn't
      even work and then pay to have them fixed?

    title: Maintenance status scrutinized
  - body: >-
      Not only that - we will ensure the wireline contractor has delivered the
      equipment and is ready to perform all services, including the non-routine
      scenarios, including drilling support, emergency procedures, etc.


      We will ensure all the equipment certificates are in date, as well as a
      certification and maintenance plan in place throughout the duration of the
      project.

      We will match the equipment with the contractual obligations and ensure
      sure you are not paying for your neighbors Porsche.

      Enforcing the Service provider's own best practices is the best forerunner
      to a LTI-free logging operation. Too many times we've heard about the
      expensive down-time incurred by inadequate tool checks on site.


      All the auxiliaries (stand-offs, decentralizers, low friction rollers) are
      attached to the string, OD's physically measured and pictures taken. We
      leave nothing to chance.
    description: >-
      With a proposed logging program in hand, we work hard with the logging
      crew to ensure all the logging string combos are thoroughly tested.

      This is a routine operation, providing all the planning was thoroughly
      laid out ahead of the time. At this stage, it is too late to think about
      the unit zonation, or devise a plan to change out the logging cable!

      Logging Well on Paper - a huge step to improving operational efficiency.
      We get together all the key people - wireline engineers and operators,
      drilling supervisor, tool pusher and performance coach - and run through
      the job, step-by-step. This is a powerful exercise and test of
      preparedness - and usually results in a number of suggestions for
      improvement. Minutes of meeting are subsequently incorporated in the final
      logging program.

      RIGPRO consultant is there 24/7 and lives through the operation with the
      logging crew. Our expert blends with the team and ensures no corners are
      cut. All the activities are tracked in RIGPRO Wireline QAQC software to a
      second - office teams are able to witness the operation as it unfolds, on
      their laptops and mobile phones. Operational database is built on the go,
      and contains all the timings and speeds.

      Within 24 hours from rigging down wireline, an AAR meeting is held with
      the key team members. Every step of the job is critically reviewed.
      Continuous improvement is driven by adding the lessons learned to the
      RIGPRO database and incorporating in future logging programs.

      Advanced statistical analysis, which is available in RIGPRO Wireline QA/QC
      software, helps us to break down the operation by segments, and to focus
      on areas where the most significant savings are achievable- without
      jeopardizing safety or data quality, this goes without saying!

      The review of the data quality is only a single part of the LQC report. A
      typical report produced by RIGPRO Wireline QA/QC software will contain
      much more - from well information, personnel and equipment overview,
      various time analyses all the way to lessons learnt and suggestions for
      future improvements. The whole package!

      Believe it or not, a typical exploration logging job will result in close
      to a hundred distinct products! It is imperative to closely track the
      status and ensure delivery of exceptional quality logs and data in a
      timely manner. This is is where a well written SOP with a well-defined
      Data Matrix comes in handy. All the data must be delivered before the end
      of the project! Once the project team is released, it becomes very
      difficult to obtain any additional logs.
