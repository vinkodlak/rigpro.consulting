      title: Predetermined Input Forms
      body: >-
        Not only are we redefining the existent approach by using predetermined
        input forms, we are also making it easier to follow the job flow and to
        be assured every single piece of information is captured. From
        collecting the information, all the way to the final report, each step
        of the process is intuitive and standardized.

        Under the RIGPRO umbrella, everyone with access to the project is
        continuously up to date with what’s going on during the wireline logging
        job. From the current tool string depth to the accurate time statistics,
        any information is readily available. Current problems, as well as
        potential issues, are distributed across the teams.

        Being in a position to wait for an update via email can be a frustrating
        communication nightmare. RIGPRO information exchange is fast, efficient
        and – best of all – not dependent on a field personnel’s ability to take
        a timeout and jot down an email. With RIGPRO on your desktop and mobile
        devices, you are constantly in touch with the logging progress. You can
        see what’s going on, your team in the office knows what’s going
        on…everyone knows what’s going on. Operational transparency and time
        efficiency is guaranteed!

        This is finally possible during the operation, because you are in the
        know at all times. Key information is entered once and is reused
        throughout the RIGPRO platform. Track the logging progress, visualize
        job flow, QC the data, and monitor tool and crew movements in real-time,
        all at your fingertips. Say, for example, the logging string is stuck
        and you need to react fast. You can visualize the logging string in a
        realistic borehole model within seconds, determine the probable sticking
        mechanism and quickly decide on a course of action.

        This captures that invisible lost time. You don’t need to be a
        statistician to use RIGPRO data. Numerous  built-in reports, charts, and
        graphs give you instant and informative visual feedback. One client was
        surprised to learn, based on RIGPRO analysis that invisible lost time -
        resulting from inadequate moving speeds - amounted to 3 hours on a
        single job. That was costing our client $210,000. How much does it cost
        you?

        Consider tendering for an upcoming EWL campaign: Is there adequate hard
        data available to support a particular choice of a service provider? Has
        the tool reliability been considered? Has historical crew performance
        been quantified and input into the equation? What about logging speeds?
        Has the best tool been selected for a given geology, mud system and
        conveyance method? Get all your answers in a few clicks – let RIGPRO
        software do the math for you.

      title: Reporting and Deliverables
      body: >-
        Always at the tip of your fingers. RIGPRO challenges a crucial paradigm
        of wireline logging QC process, by delivering a database instead of a
        document. However, everyone still needs reports… which is why there's an
        easy-to-use module just for that purpose. Now you can create a relevant
        report in just a few clicks.

      title: We're all Visual Beings
      body: >-
        See in 3D what is going on 300 miles from the rig. It’s difficult to
        envision tool-string in an immense, tens-of-thousands-of-feet deep
        borehole. Use RIGPRO’s advanced 3D borehole and calliper rendering Depth
        View 3D module that is no longer an issue. Now, you can visualize the
        tool-string in a realistic borehole model within seconds and quickly
        decide on a course of action.

Both RIGPRO client (desktop application) as well as mobile applications connect to the server, which is the heart of  the RIGPRO platform. The server is cloud based and is configured and tailored individually for each company.

In the field, we make use of a briefcase data caching model. If the internet connection is temporarily lost between the  rig and server, data will be stored locally until the connection is re-established.

The RIGPRO client app can also be used as a standalone application. This is a perfect solution for log witnesses who  don’t need the real-time communication and server backup, but still want to profit from the automated QC process. 
It provides insightful and attractive visualization tools and streamlines report creation.
