      title: Predetermined Input Forms
      body: >-
        Not only are we redefining the existent approach by using predetermined
        input forms, we are also making it easier to follow the job flow and to
        be assured every single piece of information is captured. From
        collecting the information, all the way to the final report, each step
        of the process is intuitive and standardized.

      title: Real-Time Insight
      body: >-
        Under the RIGPRO umbrella, everyone with access to the project is
        continuously up to date with what’s going on during the wireline logging
        job. From the current tool string depth to the accurate time statistics,
        any information is readily available. Current problems, as well as
        potential issues, are distributed across the teams.

Both RIGPRO client (desktop application) as well as mobile applications connect to the server, which is the heart of  the RIGPRO platform. The server is cloud based and is configured and tailored individually for each company.

In the field, we make use of a briefcase data caching model. If the internet connection is temporarily lost between the  rig and server, data will be stored locally until the connection is re-established.

The RIGPRO client app can also be used as a standalone application. This is a perfect solution for log witnesses who  don’t need the real-time communication and server backup, but still want to profit from the automated QC process. 
It provides insightful and attractive visualization tools and streamlines report creation.
