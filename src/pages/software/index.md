Both RIGPRO client (desktop application) as well as mobile applications connect to the server, which is the heart of  the RIGPRO platform. The server is cloud based and is configured and tailored individually for each company.

In the field, we make use of a briefcase data caching model. If the internet connection is temporarily lost between the  rig and server, data will be stored locally until the connection is re-established.

The RIGPRO client app can also be used as a standalone application. This is a perfect solution for log witnesses who  donâ€™t need the real-time communication and server backup, but still want to profit from the automated QC process. 
It provides insightful and attractive visualization tools and streamlines report creation.
